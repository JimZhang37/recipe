# recipe

This is a udacity android developer project. I created it from scratch.

1 For the main activity, I created a recyclerview to display recipes.
2 A viewmodel is created for the main activity.
3 A livedata is created to download recipe from Internent and transform it into a local ArrayList<Recipe> object.
4 A few class about recipe, ingredient and step are created for local data structure.
